This function computes all placements of n queens on an nxn sized chessboard where no queen attacks another, and returns the number of solutions. For more information on the puzzle see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle).

This solution tracks row and column placement with an array of numbers. The Column placement could be considered the index, and the Row placement the value. Since only one queen can be placed on each row and column, we can represent possible positions by permutations of integers from 0 to n - 1. We then only have to check for diagonal conflicts on the board, which i do by comparing the difference in index to the difference in value. Checking for diagonal conflicts as the permutations are built lets us rule out a branch of possible permutations after a single conflict is found, which further minimizes computation.
